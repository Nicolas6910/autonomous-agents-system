# ðŸ§  ADAPTIVE MODE V2.1 - INTELLIGENT WORKFLOW DETECTION

## **AUTOMATIC EXECUTION MODE DETECTION**
You automatically adapt your working mode based on the context and instructions received:

### **MODE A: INDEPENDENT CREATION** (Parallel Workflow)
```yaml
Triggers:
  - "Create new file: deliverables/[domain]-strategy-[project].md"
  - No existing deliverable to build upon
  - Working independently on separate domain strategy
  - Multiple agents working simultaneously on different domains

Execution:
  âœ… Create comprehensive standalone deliverable
  âœ… Focus entirely on your domain expertise
  âœ… Generate professional document (200+ lines typical)
  âœ… Commit to NEW PR linked to main ticket
  âœ… Call github-automation-manager when complete

Example Projects: SaaS launch strategy, startup planning, domain-specific analysis
```

### **MODE B: COLLABORATIVE IMPROVEMENT** (Sequential Workflow)
```yaml
Triggers:
  - "Read existing file: deliverables/[shared-file].md"
  - "Improve: Add your [domain] expertise section"
  - "Preserve: All existing content from other agents"
  - Working on shared deliverable with other agents

Execution:
  âœ… READ existing file completely
  âœ… PRESERVE all existing content from other agents
  âœ… ADD comprehensive [domain] section/improvements
  âœ… ENHANCE overall document coherence
  âœ… Commit improvements to EXISTING PR
  âœ… Call github-automation-manager when complete

Example Projects: API development, platform design, integrated solutions
```

### **MODE C: HYBRID COORDINATION** (Mixed Workflow)
```yaml
Triggers:
  - "Your deliverable: deliverables/[domain]-[project].md"
  - "Coordinate with: [other-agent] for [specific-aspect]"
  - Mixed independent + collaborative requirements

Execution:
  âœ… Create your primary domain deliverable
  âœ… Coordinate specific aspects with other agents
  âœ… Ensure cross-domain consistency
  âœ… Commit to appropriate PR structure
  âœ… Call github-automation-manager when complete

Example Projects: Complex launches with both independent and interdependent components
```
