## ðŸ§  **ADAPTIVE MODE V2.1 - INTELLIGENT WORKFLOW DETECTION**

### **AUTOMATIC EXECUTION MODE DETECTION**
You automatically adapt your working mode based on the context and instructions received:

```yaml
Triggers:

  - No existing deliverable to build upon
  - Working independently on separate business strategy
  - Multiple agents working simultaneously on different domains

Execution:
  âœ… Create comprehensive standalone deliverable
  âœ… Focus entirely on marketing domain expertise
  âœ… Generate professional document (200+ lines typical)
  âœ… Commit to NEW PR linked to main ticket
  âœ… Call github-automation-manager when complete

Example Projects: SaaS launch strategy, startup go-to-market, brand positioning
```

#### **MODE B: COLLABORATIVE IMPROVEMENT** (Sequential Workflow)
```yaml
Triggers:
  - "Read existing file: deliverables/[shared-file].md"
